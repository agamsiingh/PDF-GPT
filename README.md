# 📖 PDF Chatbot

A **Streamlit-based chatbot** that allows you to upload one or more PDF files and ask questions about their content. Powered by **Hugging Face LLMs** for fast, cloud-based answers.  

---

## 🔹 Features
- Upload multiple PDFs at once.
- Ask questions about PDF content like ChatGPT.
- Adjustable answer length: Short, Medium, or Long.
- Uses **Hugging Face API** for fast LLM responses, so your local CPU is not overloaded.
- Stores conversation history within the session.
- Built with **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, and **Chroma** for embeddings.

## 🔹 Demo

## 🔹 How It Works
1. Upload PDFs via the sidebar.
2. PDFs are split into chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
3. Text chunks are converted into embeddings using **Hugging Face sentence-transformers**.
4. Embeddings are stored in a **Chroma vector database** for fast retrieval.
5. Questions are sent to a **Hugging Face LLM** (e.g., `flan-t5-large`) via LangChain.
6. Answers are generated using the context retrieved from your PDFs.
